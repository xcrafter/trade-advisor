-- First, let's check for any stock_analysis records without user_id

-- Check for any stocks records without user_id

-- Check for duplicate instrument_key across different users in stock_analysis
SELECT instrument_key, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as user_count

-- Check for duplicate symbol/exchange combinations across different users in stocks
SELECT symbol, exchange, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as user_count

-- Fix conflicting constraints
